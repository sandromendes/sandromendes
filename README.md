## Hi there 👋

I'm a software engineer driven by the pursuit of excellence in software design and architecture. My journey through code is fueled by curiosity, a love for problem-solving, and the constant desire to learn something new every day.


💻 **Technologies I work with:**

C# & .NET – My go-to tools for building powerful, reliable applications with a focus on performance and scalability.
Java & Spring – Exploring the elegance of Java and the flexibility of Spring to craft robust enterprise solutions.
CQRS & DDD – Fascinated by the art of modeling complex domains and separating concerns for cleaner, maintainable architectures.
TDD & BDD – I believe that well-tested code is at the heart of every great application, and I’m always striving to improve my approach to automated testing.


🔍 **What drives me:**

I’m always looking to deepen my understanding of architectural patterns that bring simplicity and clarity to complex systems.
Clean Architecture is my blueprint for building systems that are both scalable and adaptable to change.
I thrive on opportunities to blend domain-driven design (DDD) with practical development practices, creating software that truly reflects the business needs.


🌱 **A lifelong learner:**

I believe there’s always more to discover, whether it's mastering a new design pattern or improving my skills in test automation.
Every new challenge is a chance to grow, and I approach each project with the humility of knowing that there’s always more to learn.


💡 **What inspires me:**

Collaborating with other developers who share a passion for crafting clean, efficient, and meaningful code.
Contributing to open-source projects and the wider developer community, where I can give back and help others on their own journeys.


📚 **Currently exploring:**

Diving deeper into CQRS and understanding how it can unlock even greater flexibility in large systems.
Continually refining my approach to TDD and BDD, embracing the mindset that testing drives better design.


🤝 **Let’s collaborate:**

I’m always open to new challenges, eager to connect with like-minded developers, and excited to contribute to innovative projects. Let’s learn and build something amazing together!
